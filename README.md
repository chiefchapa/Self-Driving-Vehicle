# Self-Driving-Vehicle
Hello everyone, I want to make a long term self-driving car project. When I mean a self-driving car, I refer to a RC-car-sized vehicle with Arduino and Raspberry Pi and a bunch of sensors. My plan is to follow step by step each level of autonomous vehicle (i.e from Level 1 to Level 4 or 5).  Currently, I am working with a C++ IDE and an Arduino board to program the sensors and how the vehicle should react if an object is ahead. The micro controller controls the electric motors and lights too. Integrating hardware and coding the Arduino is quite simple, but that is just 10% of the project. I would like to know how I can start with the “cool/difficult” part (machine learning, computer vision...).  I know that some people over the internet use “OpenCV” and small-sized cameras such as the ESP-32 CAM. If anyone knows how can I start or any other recommendations, I would really appreciate it.  Note: I am not a CS Major not a SWE/CompEng, but I do know the fundamentals of C/C++, and object-oriented programming.  Thanks y’all!:)
